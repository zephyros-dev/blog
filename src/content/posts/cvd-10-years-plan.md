## Introduction

- This list use mostly the same rules that I used in [The Great Books 10 Years Reading Plan](gbww-10-years-plan.md). For books that were already chosen in GBWW reading list I will provide reference link to the entry
- The second edition of the set does ommit some works, which you can check out in the [Greaterbooks website entry for this set](http://greaterbooks.com/vandoren.html)
- I think that this list is more suitable for those who prefer chronological order (but with some newer works sprinkled in), and are more focused on literature. To quote Van Doren thoughts on his list:
  > - The following reading plan is more than merely suggestive, although it is not carved in stone, either. It emphasizes classical works over recent ones, mainly because the former are less likely to be familiar, but many recent books are also on this list. There could be other books on it, replacing the ones I have chosen. But stick to my list for a while, at least, and see it if works for you.
  > - For each year I have recommended that you read ten books, but sometimes I have felt that really long works should count for more than one. This means that the number of different titles is less than one hundred. The books can be read in any order desired, although for each year they are listed in chronological order, so that might be the best way to read them. For each year, the recommended books are both instructive and entertaining, according to my lights. Some years may be harder than others, but nobody is watching you. Read as much as you can and don’t spoil your pleasure by struggling to “keep up.” There is plenty of time, even if you have to spend twenty years reading these hundred books, instead of ten.

## Footnotes

[^6.2]: Molière, *The Doctor in Spite of Himself*

    - [Reviews of various translations of his other works](https://www.editoreric.com/greatlit/books/Tartuffe-translations.html)
       > The work that has set the modern standard, however, is Richard Wilbur's 1963 translation into heroic couplets—rhyming iambic pentameter. A prominent poet himself (Things of This World, 1956), Wilbur manages to produce elegant verse with the wit intact, the result being the closest approximation we have to the effect we imagine Molière's dramatic verse achieved with French audiences of his time.
      > The 1967 translation by Donald M. Frame follows Wilbur's closely, but some of his lines are superior in my opinion. (See the examples to get an idea for yourself.)
    - I used Donald M. Frame translations for *The Doctor in Spite of Himself* since Wilbur did not translate that work
