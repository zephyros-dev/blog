## Introduction

- For information on the Great Books of the Western World set, checkout the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Books_of_the_Western_World)
- In order to aid people reading through all these books, Britannica created a Ten Year Reading Plan. To quote the Reading plan introduction:
  > - These books have for many years been used in teaching young people and in leading discussions with groups of adults. It has been found that reading whole works or integral parts of works in chronological order and, generally, in an ascending scale of difficulty is an effective way of becoming familiar with the books.
  > - The listing for each year contains twenty-one readings within the set, from which the reader may select those of particular interest rather than go through the list item by item. The Editors encourage readers to attempt some readings that may not seem immediately appealing, however; it is often in this way that one finds new treasures and makes new friends among the authors in the set.
  > - Readers who complete the ten-year program will have become acquainted with the range and depth of the Great Conversation. They will have a sense of the relations of the authors to one another and of the variety and relations of the ideas with which they deal and will be equipped to carry on their own readings of the Great Books under the direction of their own individual interests.
- While one can find the reading list online from a web search, none so far included a recommendation for the edition of each work. In this guide I'll attempt to show my choice of edition for each entry in the Ten year reading plan for the 1990 Edition of the GBWW set, which may include commercial editions
- While many of the books are available in Public Domain, some of them are not. For those interested, you can check out some resources like [Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org/collections/encyclopaedia-britannicas-great-books-of-the-western-world/downloads), [a Reddit user collection](https://www.reddit.com/r/ebooks/comments/eao9c8/great_books_of_the_western_world_ebook_collection/), or [Librivox audio book](https://wiki.librivox.org/index.php?title=Great_Books_of_the_Western_World)

## Criteria

- I'm only a hobbyist interested in general adult education, so my choice will not neccessarily be the "best" choice reflected by experts. However I'll try to include my source that contains the discussion regarding these choices. Also some of the book in the list may be prohibitively expensive to normal people, but they can be found if you know where to look
- My criteria is as of following, in order of importance:
  1. Available in ebook format
  2. Translation quality
  3. Ebook formatting
  4. Supplementary contents
- Given my priorties with the ebook edition for preservation, it may not neccessarily be the best edition in physical format
- For works that are originally in English and is available at *Standard Ebooks* (.e.g.: Shakespeare plays), I'll choose them over the commercial edition since I'm mostly interested in reading the text itself rather than doing deep research into each one, and to keep the original spirit of the set:
  > The Advisory Board recommended that no scholarly apparatus should be included in the set. No “introductions” giving the Editors’ views of the authors should appear. The books should speak for themselves, and the reader should decide for himself. Great books contain their own aids to reading; that is one reason why they are great. Since we hold that these works are intelligible to the ordinary man, we see no reason to interpose ourselves or anybody else between the author and the reader.
- For entries without footnotes, it's usually because there's only one digital edition I can find that passes the criteria

      > For the last two decades, this has widely been considered the standard edition of Plato’s works in English ... This volume offers the easiest, most accessible entry into Plato for modern English speakers.

[^1.2]: **Aristophanes**: The Clouds, Lysistrata

    - [Reddit discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/classics/comments/oxn8nn/quick_question_about_translations_of_aristophanes)
      > so i really like Poochigian (the translator of the book i linked). i think he's funny, making it less wordy and really getting the humor across without losing the Greek side of things. like as someone who's read a good portion of Clouds in Greek and is currently doing Frogs right now you can tell (kind of) how the Greek is set up by looking at Poochigian's translation, if that makes sense. but it isnt wordy, long, nor dense, as some translations that stick close to the Greek are.

[^1.4]: **Aristotle**: Nicomachean Ethics

    - For Aristotle works, Reeve working on the whole [Aristotle Corpus](https://hackettpublishing.com/new-hackett-aristotle-landing-page), and I decided to go with his edition whenever possible for consistency

[^1.9]: **Machiavelli**: The Prince

    - [Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalPhilosophy/comments/30bm6v/seeking_a_recommendation_for_a_good_edition_of/)
      > - **Anonymous**: There is a professor at the University of Texas at Austin named Maurizio Viroli (he used to teach at Princeton) and he's arguably the leading scholar for Machiavelli. I checked both of his syllabi for the classes he teaches at UT Austin and he recommends the Oxford World's Classic Edition. It's translated by Peter Bondanella, but probably the most important thing about this translation is there is an introduction by Viroli himself. As someone who has studied under Viroli at the graduate level, he's definitely worth the read.
      > - **Anonymous**: Bondanella. Includes a game changing (and accurate) translation of "si guarda al fine"- not "the end justifies the means" but rather "one must consider the final result."

[^1.10]: **Rabelais**: Gargantua and Pantagruel

    - [Comparison between translations](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProsePorn/comments/50aiya/gargantua_and_pantagruel_by_fran%C3%A7ois_rabelais/)

[^1.11]: **Montaigne**: The Essays

    - [A comparison between translations from Readthegreatbooks](https://www.readthegreatbooks.com/books/montaigne-essays-best-translation)
      > Donald M. Frame’s own translation is considered to be amore modern equivalent of Screech’s own. It has pushed this edition into the forefront and many academics use this edition today.

[^1.13]: **Locke**: Concerning Civil Government

    - While this work is also available on [Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/john-locke/two-treatises-of-government), some of his works in the reading plan are not available in either Standard Ebooks or Gutenberge, so I went with this edition

[^1.14]: **Rousseau**: The Social Contract

    - [Amazon review that compares to the Cambridge edition](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VABPMUIEG5AB?ie=UTF8&ASIN=022615131X)
      > This book is a useful and scholarly collection of Rousseau's primary political writings, with a fine translation. I previously owned the two Cambridge University Press editions of Rousseau's political writings, but I decided to replace one of them with this volume (but keep the one on Rousseau's later writings). The advantages of the Cambridge edition are that it includes additional writings, including letters and short compositions, that are not included in the Scott translation ... The Chicago edition uses footnotes rather than the confusing end-notes employed by Cambridge. The most important advantage is the translation. Scott's translation is more fluid and readable than Gourevitch's. I was surprised by this, since I have grown to expect a highly literal, "Straussian" translation from Chicago University Press (especially since the book has an endorsement by Robert Bartlett on the back cover). I cannot say whether Scott's translation is also more faithful, but it is certainly more beautiful and fluid. However, it should be noted that the differences between the translations are fairly minor; many passages are translated identically (or nearly so), and both seem to be fairly literal.

[^1.16]: The Declaration of Independence, The Constitution of the United States, The Federalist

    - This edition has all the work in a single place.
    - The Federalist Papers alone is also available in [Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/alexander-hamilton_john-jay_james-madison/the-federalist-papers)

[^1.18]: **Tocqueville**: Democracy in America

    - [Comparison between editions from Reddit user](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicalEducation/comments/yebach/whats_the_best_translation_of_democracy_in_america/)
      > - I started with the Harvey Mansfield translation. Its really good. The translation uses more modern english. I dont like Harvey Mansfield as a political commentator and some of his bias shows up here and there in the language, but that aside I dont really have any gripes or issues with the translation as a whole
      > - Finally, my favorite is the Everyman's Library edition. This is my go to translation. Anytime I recall a passage of Democracy in America, I think of this translation. The translation is based on Henry Reeves, but some of the anachronisms are modernized. I'ts a nice mix of the thoughtfulness of Reeves and the modernity of the Mansfield. One of the really, really, nice features about this translation is that it builds a vocabulary by using the same words in the same context very consistently.

[^1.19]: **Marx-Engels**: Manifesto of the Communist Party

    > [The 1888 English edition, translated by Samuel Moore and approved by Engels, who also provided notes throughout the text. It has been the standard English-language edition ever since.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Communist_Manifesto#cite_note-15)

    - [Reddit user comparision between translations](https://www.reddit.com/r/classics/comments/l7yl6h/every_modern_iliad_translation_compared/)
      > - it comes down to Murray, Hammond, Verity, and Green as my top four. The fidelity to the Greek is just as close in all three, and they are all three well-written with no obvious issues. So it comes down to my preference for the style and readability of their writing.
      > - Here, I've changed my mind since I first posted this. I thought Hammond's prose was a little flat in comparison to the other two. And so I was wavering between Murray, Green and Verity. Although I originally preferred Verity's poetry, I have read more of her work now and the somewhat random line-breaks of her false verse begin to get grating after a while. Despite Green's semi-dull choice of "deadly Archer" for Apollo's epithet, I find his poetry to be more engaging with a better flow. He also gets extra points for his translation being in true verse. Between Green and Murray, I think Green just pips him past the post for the fact that his version is in verse.
      > - This leaves my preference as Green.

[^2.2]: **Aeschylus, Euripides, Sophocles**

    - I went with [The Complete Greek Tragedies series](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/series/CGT.html) since it has all the plays in the reading plan
    - As of writing, [the whole collection with all the plays in the reading plan](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo258663871.html) will be released on September 2025, so you might want to hold off for that one. Otherwise you can take the singular edition

[^2.3]: **Sophocles**: Oedipus the King, Antigone

[^2.4]: **Herodotus**: The History

    - [Reddit user comments on various translations of this work](https://www.reddit.com/r/AYearOfMythology/comments/1bklbd8/translation_guide_the_oedipus_trilogy_theban/)
    - [Comparison between translations from Textkit forum](https://www.textkit.com/t/whats-the-best-english-translation-of-herodotus/15407/2)
      > - I’d say clearly the best translation overall is Robin Waterfield’s ... It’s a not-too-literal paraphrase of the Greek text that reproduces very faithfully the meaning but not the form of the Greek. As such, it’s of course not very useful as a crib for reading the original. Some people apparently don’t like the way Waterfield has cut up Herodotus’ long, elaborate sentences into short ones in English, but to get an adequate idea of what Herodotus really wants to say I think this is clearly the best option. The accompanying notes by Carolyn Dewald are good but rather advanced.
      > - The Landmark Herodotus can be recommended for all the additional material it contains (mostly essays, the footnotes aren’t that good), including a LOT of maps (perhaps too many). The translation is very readable but has quite a few inaccuracies.
      > - Pamela Mensch’s translation with James Romm’s introduction and notes. The translation is a bit dull, more accurate than the Landmark edition but less so than Waterfield’s, and more literal than either (the literal translation isn’t always the most accurate!). I’d mostly recommend this edition for someone who finds Dewald’s notes and introduction in Waterfield’s translation too long and advanced (say, perhaps, high school students). Romm’s unpretentious introduction and notes are aimed at someone who doesn’t know much about antiquity and do the job well without making things simpler than they really are. There are lots of notes to the text, but they are short and to the point.
      > - For a crib to help with the Greek, I’d recommend Enoch Powell’s translation, which might be hard to come by, and failing that, the Loeb. These translations are, in my opinion, worthless unless you read them with the Greek. Especially Powell’s, which is written in an archaizing thee-and-thou lingo, but is excellent help in trying to decipher the Greek original.
      > - There’s a new translation by Tom Holland, which was apparently made for teenagers who find reading boring, or perhaps with the general premise that reading is boring. A reviewer has said that this translation tries to sex up Herodotus (or something like that) and I agree. I don’t recommend this for anyone who seriously wants to get an idea of Herodotus, there are just too many inaccuracies. You can find several reviews by googling, at least one of them being surprisingly positive.
      > - Aubrey de Selincourt’s translation from the 1950’s has similar aims as Tom Holland’s, but is rather more successful. It’s not very accurate but it’s nice to read.
      > - Of the older translations, Macauley from the 19th century still has its place.

[^2.6]: **Aristotle**: Poetics

    - [Comments on edition choice from Readthegreatbooks](https://www.readthegreatbooks.com/books/aristotle-poetics-best-translation)
    - Personally I went with Oxford edition since its Table of Content in the ebook format contains all the chapter unlike the Hackett edition
    - For future reader, this work will be translated by Reeve in his [Aristotle Complete Works Volume 2](https://hackettpublishing.com/pdfs/ACW_Detailed_TOC_Book-2.pdf) which is the choice for all of our Aristotle works in the Reading plan

[^2.9]: **Lucretius**: On the Nature of Things

    - There are 3 editions with Ebook format that I've found that has written review on:
      - The first is the edition I chose, which is a translation in verse for the poem
        - [Review on Melville editions](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v20/n17/richard-jenkyns/coaxing-and-seducing)
      - The second is a [prose version by Martin Ferguson Smith](https://www.amazon.com/Nature-Things-Lucretius-ebook/dp/B008KNO816)

        - [Commentary by the author on verse vs prose translation, with brief reviews on various other translations](https://web.viu.ca/johnstoi/lucretius/lecture.htm)
    - While the Johnston is newer, the Melville and Smith version have scholarly recommendation, so my choice was between them. My preference went to the Melville version due to 2 reason:
      - The Melville version is a free verse, which I prefer since it attempts to preserve the poetic form. And, at least for the first reading (which is probably how the majority is approaching the Reading Plan), I believe the poetic form is essential to the understanding of the text. To quote Ian Johnston essay on Lucretius above:
        > On the Nature of Things is not a scientific treatise (merely or primarily) but an amazing and influential poem, which succeeds because of its poetic insight and power. To overlook that or brush it aside in the interests of isolating its scientific content is to negate the very reason the work has played such an important role in our historical development and is still a wonderful read.
      - The Smith version have a headnotes sections for each book. If you need some help reading the text this could be preferable. Personally I chose Melville edition since it does not have such summary, which is closer to my [critieria](#criteria)

[^2.13]:  **Pascal**: Pensées

    - [Comments on Penguin (Krailsheimer) and Hackett (Roger Ariew) version](https://web.archive.org/web/20250627064825/http://forum.ship-of-fools.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=70;t=027938)
      > - The best translation on the market right now is the Penguin Classics edition—the notes could use some work, but the translation captures the spirit of Pascal's French beautifully. However, it's based on the Lafuma edition of the P's—and the Sellier edition is the currently accepted standard, although there are a few Lafuma holdouts left. There are a few passages in crucial areas that are missing from the Lafuma, as well as some minor reordering of fragments; basically, it's the more complete edition, although, to be fair, the differences are usually pretty minor.
      > - The problem is that the Hackett edition, which is the only one that uses the Sellier, could be better. It's a bit stodgy sometimes, and the book itself (like most Hackett editions) could really be better organized and produced. Frankly, it's a bit of a toss-up between a better version of an older edition and a lesser version of a better edition.
    - There's also [an edition from Oxford](https://www.amazon.com/Pens%C3%A9es-Writings-Oxford-Worlds-Classics/dp/0199540365), but the Amazon reviews indicate some translations error, and it doesn't contains all Pascal manuscripts
    - The [latest edition I can find is translated by Pierre Zoberman, released in 2022](https://www.cuapress.org/9780813233468/pensees/), but there's no review of it that I can find, though some articles on Pascal uses it as source text

[^2.14]: **Pascal**: Treatise on the Arithmetical Triangle

    - [Another translation by David Pengelley](https://sidoli.w.waseda.jp/Pengelley_Pascal_Arithmetical_Triangle.pdf)
      - This one has some useful supplementary notes, but does not translate every part of the work

[^2.15]: **Swift**: Gulliver's Travels

    - The only translation that I can find from reputable publisher (Oxford). Also it is supposedly the standard edition according to Wikipedia

    - [The Complete Works of Friedrich Nietzsche by Stanford](https://www.sup.org/books/series/complete-works-friedrich-nietzsche) is the latest translation for Nietzsche with updated source material, and aim to be the scholar standard once it finishes. Unfortunately they are not available as ebook edition so I skipped them, but if you can use paperback this is probably the edition to get
    - [Review for the Judith Norman translation](https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/beyond-good-and-evil/) were quite good, and it was the latest edition other than the Stanford collection, so I went with it
    - [Reddit threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nietzsche/comments/13kaz4p/what_editionstranslations_do_you_use/)

[^2.21]: **Whitehead**: Science and the Modern World [Ch. I–VI]

    - There's also a [Dover Thrift edition that is cheaper](https://www.amazon.com/Science-Modern-World-Lectures-Philosophy-ebook/dp/B0DMQNBXXH), however this edition has some weird formatting (Italic and Coloring of random paragraph), and no chapter numbering for ToC.

        - [Comparison to other editions on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/review/R30P73TX3GFKIE/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8)

        - [Review](https://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2005/2005.07.15)
    - I chose the Oxford edition due to it being accurate enough while easier for general readers compared to the Woodman edition. The Damon translation is `bold, creative, commanding` according to the review, which does not really match my criteria

      > If the idea of reading an old-fashioned or jarringly Russian text is intimidating, try Avsey, a looser translation written in idiomatic modern English, or the newest translation by Katz.

[^3.20]: **Lévi-Strauss**: Structural Anthropology

    - In the GBWW, only a partial part of the full work was selected to be put into the volume. According to [an advertisement brochure for the 2nd edition](https://web.archive.org/web/20230531062640/http://resourcecentre.daiict.ac.in/cas/bibliographies/greatbooks/great_books_09.pdf), this part was *Chapters I-VI, IX-XII, XV, XVII*

[^4.8]: **Calvin**: Institutes of the Christian Religion

    - I chose this edition since it is considered the authoritative edition of the work according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutes_of_the_Christian_Religion#cite_note-22)

[^4.11]: **Bacon**: Novum Organum

    - [A comparison between editions from Readthegreatbooks](https://www.readthegreatbooks.com/books/bacon-novum-organum-%28new-organon%29-best-translation)
      > The best option is that of Hackett’s. It balances the line between too much and too little quite well. It is easily readable but doesn’t skimp on details or notations, while at the same time it isn’t overly done.

[^4.12]: **Descartes**: Discourse on the Method

    - [Discussion of edition choice on Stackexchange](https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/55613/what-are-the-best-translations-of-descartes-books)
      > For Descartes' major philosophical works the current Cambridge tr., 'The Philosophical Writings of Descartes', is probably the best both in terms of the Latin and French scholarship that has gone into it and in terms of philosophical finesse by which it is informed. Other translations, Hackett's or Penguin's, are pretty good but are not so complete (include fewer texts) than the Cambridge edition.
    - A [review on Amazon also recommend Oxford editions if you find this edition too challenging](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33YXKD7VNWS7B?ie=UTF8)

[^4.13]: **Newton**: Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy

    - This is the latest translations with Ebook format available. For paperback users I found 2 other editions worth noting:
      - Dana Densmore and William H. Donahue [edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1888009241) which [was developed as a textbook for classes at St. John's College and the aim of this translation is to be faithful to the Latin text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica#cite_note-129), so it might be best suited for the readers of the set
      - Charles Leedham-Green [edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1107020654) which [aim was to convey Newton's own reasoning and arguments in a way intelligible to a modern mathematical scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica#cite_note-127)

[^4.19]: **William James**: The Principles of Psychology

    - While there are many editions of this work on Amazon, including Gutenberg, I chose the Dover edition due to it having footnotes hyperlink, and proper chapter with sections in table of contents

[^4.20]: **Frazer**: The Golden Bough

    - In the GBWW series, only a partial part of the full work was selected to be put into the volume. According to [an advertisement brochure for the 2nd edition](https://web.archive.org/web/20230531062640/http://resourcecentre.daiict.ac.in/cas/bibliographies/greatbooks/great_books_09.pdf), this part was *Chapters I-IV, LXVI-LXIX*
    - The original work itself has many editions according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Bough), however given the Chapters numbering, I found that it matches the 1922 edition so I went with it.
      - The latest edition from reputable publish with Ebook format is from [Oxford](https://www.amazon.com/Golden-Bough-Religion-Oxford-Classics-ebook/dp/B005OQH0ZI), but since its version numbering was not matching the selections above, I decided to use the version that was used in the original GBWW series
    - If you want nicer formatting and an introduction, there's the [Penguin version](https://www.amazon.com/Golden-Bough-Religion-Penguin-Classics-ebook/dp/B003FXCSTK). The text and footnotes are the same however

[^5.6]: **Virgil**: The Aeneid

    - [A massive comparisons between the translations edition](https://coolest.substack.com/p/english-translations-of-the-aeneid)
      > - Ahl: More than anyone else, Ahl seems to have striven to capture every possible facet of the original: the meter, the wordplay, the assonance & alliteration, the meaning… it’s all there. Most must choose between “accurate, but not an object of literary value per se” vs. “poetic & artful, but not very true to the source”; for my money, Ahl has—somehow—managed to have his libum (archive), and eat it too.
      > - Ruden: Sure, sure, it is not the Sacred Hexameter… but it is an extremely faithful rendering—more-so than most—and she still manages word choice finer than Bartsch’s & phrasing more natural than Krisak’s, to my mind’s… ear(?); and, not infrequently, her brevity makes it a smoother & easier read compared to Ahl’s (relative) prolixity.

[^5.8]: **Plotinus**: Sixth Ennead

    - [NPR review on the chosen edition](https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/the-enneads/)
      > Although the team whose work it is points out that it is not meant to replace the Loeb translation, it has clear and significant advantages over the latter. First, it is based on a superior Greek text, for it takes into account all the corrections introduced by Henry and Schwyzer in the third volume of their editio minor and in subsequent work. Second, it reports almost all the references listed in the editio minor, while also adding to them a considerable number of cross-references. Third, it is very often more readable than Armstrong's translation, and, being in one volume (without the facing Greek text) rather than in seven, it is much easier to consult.

[^5.10]: **Dante**: The Divine Comedy

    - [Reddits comment on the chosen edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicliterature/comments/1j5uit6/comment/mpso4dv/)
      > - Sayers-Reynolds tries to reproduce Dante's terza rima to varying degrees of success and failure. The successes are superlative, the failures like nails across a board.
      > - Musa is simple and clear and often has an understated beauty, but his poetry is not very memorable. His words don't linger in the mind.
      > - Ciardi is perhaps the most popular choice for most people, often gorgeously poetic, but less formally faithful to Dante. He plays too fast and loose for my tastes.
      > - The Hollanders get the job done well enough, they're "literal" for lack of a better word, at the same time there's enough "music" in their translation as well, so many find it strikes and good balance. However I think most of the music in their translation is owing less to them and more to the fact that they've more or less turned Sinclair/Singleton's prose into verse form, which the Hollanders admit in their introduction. See also Madison Sowell's review of the Hollanders' Paradiso which should be available to read for free online. The Hollanders' notes are extremely detailed and systematic and comprehensive, even overwhelming so, and that's the primary reason I use them.
      > - Nichols is beautiful. I'd suggest Nichols is something of a Mandelbaum mixed with a Musa. By the way, it's interesting to note not all the translations are done by poets. Yet poets who are also good translators typically capture what good translators alone cannot always capture.
      > - Mandelbaum's translation of The Divine Comedy is very good. It doesn't use Dante's terza rima scheme except incidentally and when it is natural for him to do so. Nevertheless Mandelbaum captures Dante quite well, I think, and often Mandelbaum does so sublimely and elegantly. All in all, I think Mandelbaum is one of the best English translations in a crowded field.
      > - Michael Palma. His entire Commedia was only published last year in 2024. I'm working my way through it now. So far, I'm beyond impressed. It may prove to be one of the best translations. Already it has received rave reviews for apparently (mostly) successfully realizing terza rima in English. Of the major English translations I'm aware of, I think only Dorothy Sayers and Robert Pinsky have attempted to fully realize terza rima in English. Ciardi and others have tried a dummy terza rima where the first and third lines rhyme but the second line is blank verse. However, in all of these cases, from Sayers to Pinsky to Ciardi to Nichols and others, I don't think they entirely succeed. Their attempts are valiant, and there are some or many pitch perfect renderings, but overall I'm afraid to say I think they fall short, for their rhymes are by and large uneven and lacking rather than full. They're still fine translations for other reasons, but their terza rima doesn't quite work in the end. I hope Palma truly has succeeded, for that would be quite a feat to say the least!

[^5.13]: **Spinoza**: Ethics

    - [NDPR reviews of the edition](https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/ethics-proved-in-geometrical-order/)
    > This critical edition, reportedly more similar to the Van Vloten and Land edition than the more often cited Carl Gebhardt version, benefits in its preparation from the timely discovery in 2010 in the Vatican archives of a copy of Ethics supposedly handwritten by Spinoza's correspondent, Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus. Silverthorne and Kisner's translation therefore can claim to get us closer to the original manuscript, i.e., one less layer of betrayal.

[^5.14]: **Berkeley**: The Principles of Human Knowledge

    - [Annotated editions from Oxford](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Knowledge-Dialogues-Oxford-Classics-ebook/dp/B006A2INEC)

[^5.17]: **Tolstoy**: War and Peace

    - [Welovetranslations comparisons of translations](https://welovetranslations.com/2021/08/31/whats-the-best-translation-of-war-and-peace/#translator-11)
      > My first choice would be the Maude/Mandelker translation. This edition from Oxford is now the most recent, and seems like a good balance between smooth, non-modernized English and text updated to correct errors. It contains notes and other reader aids, and is available as a hardcover, paperback, or ebook. Tolstoy himself approved of the Maude translation. Contains French passages with English in the footnotes.

[^5.20]: **Waddington**: The Nature of Life

    - Also available in the [Compilation Works from Routledge](https://www.amazon.com/Selected-Works-Waddington-Routledge-Revivals-ebook/dp/B097HYQ8FY)
      - It is expensive however, so not for the general consumer. I believe those with institutional access can borrow it, and it is also available if you know where to look

[^6.2]: **Homer**: The Odyssey

    - I went with this version for consistency with the translator from The Iliad [^2.1]

[^6.5]: **Tacitus**: The Histories

    - The chosen edition is the only one I can find that has ebook format
    - Other options for paperback edition includes:
      - [Everyman's Library](https://www.amazon.com/Annals-Histories-Tacitus-Cornelius/dp/1841593117)
      - [Oxford](https://www.amazon.com/Histories-Oxford-Worlds-Classics/dp/0199540705)

[^6.7]: **St. Augustine**: The City of God

    - [Readthegreatbooks comparison of different editions](https://www.readthegreatbooks.com/books/st-augustine-city-of-god-best-translation)
      > For those of us with little prior experience in this sort of work there is Oxford’s Reader’s Guide edition. It does a great job at a scholarly approach to the subject from all different angles. So it may be a good choice for those who ask “so what” when they see City of God. The biggest qualm I have with this one is, it’s only a companion piece, the original text isn’t included. While I do consider this as a good guide to the work, it does have a surprisingly large price tag attached for a companion piece. Next up is the New City Press’ Study Edition. This is a great find for students. It has a solid introduction and some great annotations to boot. There’s only one real hiccup with this one. That being that it is separated into two volumes, while this doesn’t seem bad, for those of us who are students the price on both hasn’t seem to have gone down since it’s release. At least not for a new copy. While price shouldn’t be a dealbreaker, it doesn’t do enough to be separated into two upper priced sections, there’s just options that do more for less. If you’re a higher level student or scholar, the Cambridge University copy is more your speed. It goes heavy into the meaning and context of Augustine’s words and how they relate to the world. It includes a nice translation, solid notes, and an added bibliography and layout of Augustine’s life as well. The drawback of this is it may not be suited for those not already knowledgeable in the area. It has a heavy handed political and historic approach to it all, and that can be a little intimidating. The best of the best of this list is Penguin Classics’ copy. It balances great translation and context from scholars well known for their study of the era. It is the best here for it’s readability. No matter your level in the subject you won’t find this too dense or too watered down.

[^7.6]: **Epictetus**: Discourses

    - [Reddit discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/yrk0e1/looking_for_the_best_translation_of_epictetus/)
      > These are my own amateurish impressions having read the three main modern translations. Other people may have different responses:
      > - Robert Dobbin, (2008), Discourses and Selected Writings. Penguin Classics
      >   - Pros: A clear, efficient translation in modern English
      >   - Cons: Only contains two-thirds of the Discourses. Dobbin also takes liberties with the text, and is not always fully faithful to Epictetus' words.
      > - Robin Hard, (2014), Discourses, Fragments, Handbook. Oxford University Press
      >   - Pros: Rigorously accurate. Perhaps as close to Epictetus' actual words you can get with a translation
      >   - Cons: The price of this precision is a high word count, which does affect its readability a little
      > - Robin Waterfield, (2022), The Complete Works: Handbook, Discourses, and Fragments. The University of Chicago Press
      >   - Pros: Has the clarity and efficiency of Dobbin's translation but is also close to the accuracy of Hard's translation.
      >   - Cons: More expensive

[^8.1]: **Aristophanes**: The Poet and the Women, The Assemblywomen, Wealth

    - For *Women at the Thesmophoria*, I chose this edition since it is the newest one (2024)
    - There's also [an older edition](https://www.amazon.com/Aristophanes-translation-introduction-Oxford-Classics-ebook/dp/B018J13P9E) with [good review](https://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2016/2016.05.46), however at 130$ the price is too steep to be considered
      - There's also [another edition from Penguin](https://www.amazon.com/Frogs-Other-Plays-Penguin-Classics-ebook/dp/B002RI9LLM)
    - For *Wealth*, it is the only digital edition from reputable publisher that I can find
